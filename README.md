<h4>By. Alexander Ramirez, Christine Wang, Jiaxi Tang, i dont know yalls name so please add it urself</h4>

<h2>Project Description:</h2>
<p>This project aims to classify cancer cells as either benign or malignant using machine learning algorithms. The dataset consists of 570 samples of cancer cells, each described by 30 features. The two types of cancers included in the dataset are benign cancer (B) and malignant cancer (M).</p>
<p>The project involves building and testing various machine learning models to determine the best approach for accurately classifying the cancer cells. The models will be evaluated based on their accuracy, precision, and recall in correctly identifying the benign and malignant tumors.</p>
<p>Data analysis will also be performed to gain insights into the characteristics of the benign and malignant tumors and identify any patterns or correlations in the data that can be leveraged to improve the accuracy of the classification models.</p>
